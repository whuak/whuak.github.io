I am a year-1 MPhil student in Computer Science Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). Currently, I am working with [Dr. Haoran Li](https://hlibt.student.ust.hk/) on mitigating LLM privacy issues via [Contextual Integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_integrity). During my undergraduate studies, I had the fortune of working with [Prof. Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/) on ML safety. 

If you are interested in my works or would like to collaborate with me, please feel free to contact me via email (whuak at connect dot ust dot hk).
